# SpotiWar

This project was originally createad by Axel Warneke as a challenge in Globant's Bootcamp for a Junior position.
In that moment it was implemented using Angular 8 and developed without having previous knoledge in Angular.
Nowadays I'm using this project to apply all the knowledge I've learn throughout the years with good practices and more.
Take in mind it is a side project and it's not completly done.
